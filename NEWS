Kodkod 1.5.1

* Fixed a bug in CryptoMiniSat bindings.  Thanks to Jasmin Blanchette.

* Fixed a bug in Lingeling bindings.  Thanks to Jasmin Blanchette.

Kodkod 1.5 (September 24, 2011)

* Includes JNI bindings for the latest SAT solvers:
	- MiniSat 2.2.0 (library name 'minisat')
	- CryptoMiniSat 2.9.1 (library name 'cryptominisat')
	- Lingeling 276 (library name 'lingeling')

* Includes support for Plingeling 276 as an external library.  The program is
  statically linked and the engine communicates with it by reading/writing
  files in DIMACS format.  It is loaded automatically, by searching 
  java.library.path for 'plingeling'.

* Includes updated support for older solvers that perform well or have features
  not provided by newer solvers:
  	- MiniSat 1.14 (outperforms newer solvers on many benchmarks; library version suffix 1.14)
  	- MiniSatP 1.14 (provides proof logging; library name 'minisatprover')
  	- ZChaff Mincost (provides solution minimization; library name 'zchaffmincost')

* The JNI loading process can be configured to look for different versions of a
  given library in a specific order.  If the engine is unable to load the SAT 
  library 'satlib', it will query the system property 'kodkod.satlib' to obtain 
  a string of version suffixes, separated by the system-specific path-separator
  character (e.g., colon on Unix).  It will then try loading the versions of
  the library identified by concatenating the library name with each of the 
  suffixes in turn (e.g. 'satlib2.0').  The suffix property for a particular
  solver can be set at the command line via -Dkodkod.satlib="1.0:2.0:3.0".
  
* Fixed a bug in translation caching.  Thanks to Matvey Arye.
